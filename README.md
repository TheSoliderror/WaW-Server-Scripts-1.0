# WaW-Server-Scripts-1.0
For now there is only two scripts for this, more will come as my others are completed. There currently is a counter and a discord water mark you need to edit yourself.
# Using the installer
When you download these scripts make sure they are all in the same folder ALL BY THEMSELFS. for example; make a new folder add the 3 files from this github and then run the
installer. This is importent for the installer because if you do not do this it will install anything the installer is next to, to the scirpt folder of waw.
